	<p>Hello World Wide Web! As of late, I've decided that I would delve into the world of web developement. I gained a fascination with computers around the age of seven or eight. In those days, roughly the early nineties, my dad would bring his laptop opperating on MS-DOS home from work and I would stay up late playing Space Invaders until my eyes were bloodshot. Out of necessity I learned the command line and out of curiosity wondered what else it could do. Thus began the flame for proggraming.</p>
	<p>Here a few things I'm interested in:</p>
